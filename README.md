## Hi there 👋

I'm an AI Engineer passionate about designing intelligent systems that bridge the gap between raw data and meaningful action. My work lives at the intersection of deep learning, computer vision, and document intelligence — transforming how machines interpret visuals and text in the real world.

🔍 I enjoy working on practical AI solutions — from understanding scanned documents to building models that “see” and “read” like humans, only faster and at scale.

🛠️Currently based in Kolkata, I focus on building AI models that tackle real-world problems in computer vision and document understanding.

- 🔭 My current work involves solving computer vision challenges — teaching machines to interpret images and documents in meaningful ways.<br>
- 🌱 Along the way, I’m deepening my expertise in deep learning and exploring the evolving field of generative AI.<br>
- 👯 I’m always open to collaborating on AI projects, especially those that push boundaries and offer real-world impact.
